        <p align="center" style="color:black; font-size:18px;">
          Welcome! To get the best results of beating your addiction/impulse/whatever it may be,
           there are some suggestions I have for you.
           <br><br>
           First, I suggest that you keep in mind what an addiction to anything is:
           <br>
           An addiction to some entity A develops as one continues to find pleasure in the entity A.
           As more and more pleasure is received, the brain will strengthen more and more neurons that associate pleasure
           with A. As a result: The stronger the associations with A, the greater pull one feels towards A when s/he isn't using A.
           <br>
           An example: When you are hungry, your brain provides thoughts of food and eating. This is because
           the pains of hunger transform into pleasure when the body receives food. The hungrier one is, the
           more thoughts s/he will have about food and consumption, as humans are directly addicted to eating (because
           not eating results in death).

           <br><br>
           My next suggestion is to spend more time away from your computer and phone when you don't need to be on them.
           <br>
           In my experience, spending time with family, friends, outdoors, and with people in my free time
           helped me escape thoughts regarding porn and porn use. Of course, when I have to use my computer for homework
           and etc, I try to focus on my homework. When a distracting thought appears, I'll stop what I'm doing and
           go talk to a friend or get away from my computer for a bit.

           <br><br>
           In the case that you feel tempted to visit porn while on your phone, visit instead the sites you've
           saved in <em>PorNo!</em> on your computer. This may help redirect your energy and thoughts to the same level
           as your computer does.

           <br><br>
           Spend more time with members of your desired sexual preference (ie I am a heterosexual male, so my desired preference of gender is female).
           <br>
           By interacting with more "real people" of the gender, you dissolve your brain's strong images of porn associated with the desired gender.
           This is very helpful with overcoming the false ideas portrayed in porn, resulting in giving you a better understanding of the people in the
           world. Additionally, you'll meet some very cool people along the way, and your brain will rewire its pleasure receptors
           with the appreciation of individuals beyond surface level, which weakens the pull that porn has on your mind and possibly
           helping you make some super neat friends!

           <br><br>
           Finally, commit. Make a resolution and resolve it. Fail unwillingly, succeed willingly.
           <br>
           Treat this journey with the discipline you would if you trained for your favorite sport/hobby/profession/etc.
           <br>
           The effects of porn use are quite terrible, and the benefits of overcoming them are quite terrific. You won't miss
           out on anything once you've stopped filling your time with porn -- in fact, you'll find yourself spending that time on
           things you enjoy and bring you greater joy.
           <br>
           This process of this detox is tough, but not impossible. Every time you relapse, note down what contributed to you
           relapsing. Learn how to avoid those factors, and try again. The more you learn about the habits you've created and how to avoid
           them, the better you'll get at overcoming your urges. If it helps, get a friend to join you on your journey to
           help serve as extra motivation.
           <br>

           <br><br>
           You've got what it takes, but there will be times where it will take everything you've got.
           <br>Make a better future, right now.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <p id="list" align="center">1. Find all the websites, articles, songs, pictures...etc,
          that motivate and empower you. The more meaningful your links, the more meaningful your experience!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p align="center" style="color:black; font-size:18px;">
          For example, here are some links I use and why:
          <br>
          <a href="https://github.com/mrvivacious?tab=repositories" target="_blank">
            My Github.</a>My projects inspire me to keep trying
            to improve what I build and to start/keep working on the ideas I have.
          <br>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2r8X6GaxN4&list=LLbXFsP9kfnG3cUVvuz2v6HA" target="_blank">
            My favorite music.</a>Listening to my favorite songs brings me greater and longer-lasting pleasure than
            what I'd gain from watching porn. I'll happily lose myself in music over losing parts of myself.
          <br>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmbWDhyY94o" target="_blank">
            "Japan's DJ Monk Spins the Holiest Beats"</a>This video tells the story of a DJ who realized that he
             could use music to convey messages of spirituality to others. Spritiuality and religion are important to me
             and this video makes for a nice example of how we can continue to use modern technology and methods to make it easier
              to share the simple ideas and beliefs that discuss acceptance, peace, love...etc that I wish to encourage more of in the world.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <p id="list" align="center"><em>2. Copy the website address (http://www.example.com) and paste
          it into the input box above the add button in the </em>PorNo!<em> menu.</em>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p align="center" style="font-size:18px;">Adding a name in the "Name this link?" input box will display
          the title in the menu instead of the address to make the menu easier to read.
           If this box is left blank, the website's address is displayed. Now, click the add button!
        </p>

        <hr>
        <p id="list" align="center">3. Adding local files.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p align="center" style="font-size:18px;">You can add files on your computer too!
          Just open a file in your browser (for example, right-click on an image
          saved to your desktop, select "Open with Chrome", and the image should open in your browser window). Copy the file path in the search bar,
           paste it into <em>PorNo!</em>, name the link if you desire, and select add. That's how you add files!
        </p>

        <hr>
        <p id="list" align="center">4. To delete links, simply click the x in the rightmost side of each link.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p id="list" align="center">5. The EMERGENCY button.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p align="center" style="font-size:18px;">The EMERGENCY button is there for the times
          when you feel that you could use a little bit more help. Clicking it opens all of the links you've saved,
           so that you can view all the things that inspire you, empower you, define you...as a gentle reminder of what's important.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p id="list" align="center">6. Receiving updates.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p align="center" style="font-size:18px;">There are two ways to receive updates!
          <br>The first way is to do nothing. As I push updates to <em>PorNo!</em>, your version of <em>PorNo!</em> will update automatically!
          <br>The second way is to open the <em>PorNo!</em> menu for a few seconds every now and then. Due to the way <em>PorNo!</em> is written,
           <em>PorNo!</em> is allowed to communicate with the <em>PorNo!</em> database only when the menu is open. By opening the menu for 5 to 10 seconds once every few days,
            you allow your copy of <em>PorNo!</em> to download the latest links straight from the database.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p id="list" align="center">7. Notify Vivek of problems.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p align="center" style="font-size:18px;">Found a problem with <em>PorNo!</em>? Found some websites that bypassed
          the algorithm? Feel like sharing how you've benefited from <em>PorNo!</em>, and everything else? Send me an email at
          <a href="mailto:jvnnvt@gmail.com?Subject=PorNo!" target="_top">jvnnvt@gmail.com</a>
          Any and all mail is appreciated ^_^ .
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p id="list" align="center"><em>Extra: For those who want to use </em>PorNo!<em> anonymously for whatever reason,</em>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p align="center" style="font-size:18px;">Right-click on the <em>PorNo!</em> icon
          (yellow heart) and select "Hide in Chrome Menu". To access <em>PorNo!</em>, select the row of three vertical dots
           in the rightmost side of your browser (to the right of the website address bar)
           and select the <em>PorNo!</em> icon. <em>PorNo!</em>'s menu will appear for full use, but will disappear back into hiding when you're finished
            using it. All the functionality of <em>PorNo!</em>, tucked away for your desired privacy!
          <br>To bring the icon back, right-click on the icon while in the menu and select "Keep in toolbar".
