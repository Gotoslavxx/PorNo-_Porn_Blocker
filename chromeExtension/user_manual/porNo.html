        <h3 align="center">Why does <em>PorNo!</em> exist?</h3>
          <p align="center">
            One spring day of 2018, I just finished watching porn and then began listening to music.
            The pleasure I felt from my music was far greater and more deeply connected
            to myself than what I felt from watching porn, and I wondered why.
            <br>As I am unhappy with my porn use, I thought of how convenient it would be
            if a porn-blocker existed that redirected me from porn to sites that made me feel
            much more pleasure, such as my music.
            <br>I realized that I could create such a porn-blocker.
            <br>That was when <em>PorNo!</em> began.
          </p>
          <hr>

          <h3 align="center">What does <em>PorNo!</em> do and how?</h3>
            <p align="center">
              My experience with porn-blockers I've tried is as follows:
              <br>I visit a porn site, and
              <br>My browser shows me either a parental controls page, or a
              <br>Blank white screen.
              <br>
              <br>
              There were several problems I found with these blockers. One problem
               was that my sexual energy was still remaining, even if my computer
               stopped loading the sites. Several times I found myself removing the porn-blockers
               I installed to satisfy the persistent urges.
              <br>Another problem was that the blockers would sometimes flag sites that weren't
               adult in nature and content, but may have used questionable language in the webpage.
               This frustrated my general browsing experience.
              </p>
              <p align="center">The idea of converting unwanted sexual energy into productive,
                more-fulfilling actions is <em>PorNo!</em>. Instead of having to deal with
                this unwanted sexual energy, blank website, and easily-uninstallable blocker,
                we can "distract" ourselves from our temptations with sources of motivation,
                fulfilling, positive, forward-moving, inspiring....etc outlets!
                <br>This took care of the first problem.
              </p>
              <p align="center">For the second problem, <em>PorNo!</em> uses a database of websites
                 that have been (at the time of testing) checked to contain adult-content, and the algorithm
                 only adds sites to the database that test true for containing pornographic content.
                 <br>This way, we don't flag any non-pornographic sites as porn, interrupting the browsing experience,
                 and we convert any unwanted or excess sexual energy into that which makes us, us.
            </p>
            <hr>

          <h3 align="center">What is the <em>PorNo!</em> algorithm?</h3>
            <p align="center">
              This is how <em>PorNo!</em> works, aka "my homemade porn detection algorithm."
              <br> I share my "secret" because I believe this
              is the best idea of addressing porn and sexual energy that I've seen yet.
              Considering this, if anyone sees my algorithm and comes up with something better,
              I want that person to go and produce it, because the real beneficiaries of this product
              are the people of this planet.
              <br>
              <br>Every time a user visits a website, we grab the name of that website through its url.
              <br>First, we check if the name matches any porn names collected and stored inside the app.
               If we have a match, this website is porn, and we redirect the user to a site randomly selected
               from the user's saved links.
              <br>Additionally, we collect the latest links from <em>PorNo!</em>'s database and check against those as well.
               If we have a match, we begin the redirect process. Otherwise, if we don't have a match with the latest links,
               we use <em>natural language processing</em> to calculate the pornographic factor of the current webpage
               (aka we count the number of adult words in the url). If we achieve our set threshold, we then activate
               an api request of this website's domain name with the
                <a href="https://api.xforce.ibmcloud.com/doc/#URL_get_url_url" target="_blank">IBM XFORCE URL lookup api</a>.
               <br>If the api returns true for pornographic detection, we redirect the user and save the domain of the site to the
               database. Now, every user who has the most updated version of <em>PorNo!</em> will also gain the link just
               saved to their version of the app -- these are realtime updates and saves me a tonnnn of time when pushing out
               new updates. I will one day produce a more in-depth explanation of this process, complete with pictures.
            </p>

          <hr>
          <h3 align="center">Goals of <em>PorNo!</em></h3>
            <p align="center">
              <em>PorNo!</em> still has a ways to go before it can become an absolute
              solution to countering porn.
              <br>
              <br>Faster. Sometimes, parts of an adult side will load before the redirect activates. This happens when we wait
              for IBM to respond with our api request.
               Any adult content seen will reward the human mind with dopamine of the wrong nature.
                The faster the implementation of the algorithm and the more links saved in the database,
                the less time is allowed for a porn site to load and the closer we get to dissolving porn's effects and control
                in our minds and lives.
              <br>Larger database. The more links saved to the database, the more links added to the source code of <em>PorNo!</em>, and
              that results in near-zero time for the algorithm to activate.
              <br>
              <br>Complete dissolution of the porn industry. This goal is more ambitious and the chances of accomplishing
              it through one tiny Chrome extension are quite slim. Nonetheless, <em>PorNo!</em> is a small step towards this
              long path, and I hope that my work can inspire another to knock down another
              domino in the series of dominos that need to fall to accomplish the fall of the porn industry.
