## 0.0.1.7

- (Feature) Streak! See how long it's been since your last redirect. Hopefully this helps motivate users to keep going during tougher times.
- (Feature) Link to subreddit has been added. Join the subreddit and leave feedback about this version update!
- (Lists) Updated banlist.

**Data** This version collects new data. No personal information / identifiable information is collected.
Specifically, a list of every redirect is saved (this is used to calculate the streak). Additionally, the list of (anonymous!) redirects are uploaded to 
 the PorNo! database to help set up "overall project analytics" coming in the future.
Again, NO PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED, if you are conscious of your data you can rest easy knowing that nobody can trace the PorNo! database to any specific user, let alone any user at all.
