## 0.0.1.8 Chrome Extension

- (Bug fix) Issue with PorNo! attempting to redirect to `/lastTimestampSynced`. This bug has been taken care of and PorNo! will redirect as usual.

***

## 0.0.1.7 Chrome Extension

- (Feature) Streak! See how long it's been since your last redirect. Hopefully this helps motivate users to keep going during tougher times.
- (Feature) Link to subreddit has been added. Join the subreddit and leave feedback about this version update!
- (Lists) Updated banlist.

**Data** This version collects new data. No personal information / identifiable information is collected.
Specifically, a list of every redirect is saved (this is used to calculate the streak). Additionally, the list of (anonymous!) redirects are uploaded to 
 the PorNo! database to help set up "overall project analytics" coming in the future.
Again, NO PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED, if you are conscious of your data you can rest easy knowing that nobody can trace the PorNo! database to any specific user, let alone any user at all.

***

## 0.0.1.6 Chrome Extension

- (Improvement) Better filtering for NSFW subreddits to avoid flagging an entire, potentially SFW subreddit because of an arbitrary NSFW post [that was most likely flagged to hide spoilers as opposed to containing genuinely NSFW material].

***

## 0.0.1.5 Chrome Extension

- (Feature) Redirection and detection support for NSFW subreddits.
- (Improvement) Slight improvement to the detection algorithm, now support websites that are generally SFW but have an NSFW section as a path in the URL (ie. "test.com/adultstuff", "test2.com/nsfw")
