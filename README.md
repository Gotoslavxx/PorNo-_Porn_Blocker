# Note to self

    Your problems with porn are not my issue.
    
    Your welfare is not my priority.
    
    I work on this project for my own amusement. 
    I am not your friend.   
    
    If there are ways to improve the software / issues with the software, I am 
     listening at jvnnvt@gmail.com and the ourlastpornblocker Subreddit.
    
    Thank you for your time.
    
## Why?
March 2018, I was dealing with a break up off a nasty relationship, and I was using porn to feel less bad/pain/hurt/etc.

When I listened to my favorite music, I noticed I felt good off that. As music doesn't come with the dangers that porn use brings, I thought it would be cool if, whenever I went to a porn site (which was frequent during that time), I instead was shown my favorite music.

This technology didn't exist. I was in college studying computer science (and astronomy), and I thought I could try to build this kind of porn blocker.

The PorNo! Chrome Extension was released in July 2018.
The PorNo! Android app was released in January 2019.

## How to use
- See [Installation](#installation) for updating the lists
- Download, deploy, visit a porn site, add a redirect site, visit a porn site.
- Chrome
  - blahblah
- Android
  - blah blah

## [Installation](#contents)
### Updating the lists
If you've modified `lists/`, apply your changes with `./generateLists.py` or `python generateLists.py` in a terminal   
    
This command will update `chromeExtension/lists.js` and `androidApp/app/src/main/java/us/mrvivacio/porno/Domains.java`
    
### Release builds:
#### Chrome Extension
Click [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/porno-porn-blocker-beta/fnfchnplgejcfmphhboehhlpcjnjkomp) or click the "Available in the Chrome Web Store" button at the top of the README

#### Android App
Click [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.mrvivacio.porno&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1) or click the "Get it on Google Play" button at the top of the README

### Developmental builds:
#### Chrome Extension
1. Clone this repo to an easy-to-find place on your computer. For example, this bash command clones the repo to a folder called porNo in your Desktop:

```
 cd Desktop && git clone https://github.com/mrvivacious/PorNo-_Porn_Blocker.git porNo
```
2. Enter `chrome://extensions/` in the Google Chrome omnibox / search bar
3. Turn on `Developer mode` in the top right corner of the window
4. Click `Load unpacked` in the top left corner of the window
5. Navigate to the folder you cloned PorNo and double-click the `chromeExtension` folder
6. If successful, give yourself a pat on the back.

#### Android App:
1. Same as above
2. Open `androidApp/` in Android Studio
3. Read [this](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app)
4. NOTE: For Firebase stuff to work, you will need a [google-services.json file](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) (and probably need to create the project, create the database, etc)

**Note: I don't have a magic CI/CD pipeline at the moment where y'all can recieve the latest changes to the repositories so just make sure you `git pull` regularly thx**
