√ thoughts.html -- my thoughts regarding how porn works (gender role promotion,
   masculinity and misogyny promotion, sexual drive increase + decrease of other non-sexual stimuli...)
   and
   the importance of not using it at all (don't support it, don't support sex trade and sex work,
    sexual fulfillment can be attained through healthier means)
  This are all my theories, finding support for them would be solid tho $$$$$
